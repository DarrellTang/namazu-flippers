# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-05-07)

**Core value:** A single button gives you today's best arbitrage route. Follow it, buy, list, done in under 20 minutes. Every day.
**Current focus:** Phase 4 — Core UI
**Build model:** macOS local builds are not expected to compile without Dalamud SDK assemblies; use source validation locally and GitHub Actions as the authoritative compiler/package gate.

## Current Position

Phase: 4
Plan: Not started
Next: 04 — Core UI
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-05-06

Progress: ████░░░░░░ 43%

**Phase 1 deliverables:**

- NamazuFlippers solution + project (net10.0-windows, Dalamud.NET.Sdk/15.0.0)
- Plugin manifest (API level 15, /nflip command)
- Entry point with IDalamudPlugin lifecycle
- Configuration class (14 props, CONF-01 through CONF-09, IPluginConfiguration)
- FirstRunWindow with 85-world validation
- GitHub Actions CI/CD: cross-platform build (Ubuntu), auto-versioned releases, pluginmaster.json for Dalamud custom repo
- .gitignore for build artifacts

**Phase 3 validation/build status:**

- `tests/phase03_nyquist.sh` provides source-level automated validation for SCAN-01 through SCAN-04.
- GitHub Actions downloads Dalamud into `DALAMUD_HOME` and should be used for compile/package verification.
- macOS `dotnet build NamazuFlippers/NamazuFlippers.csproj` fails in this workspace because Dalamud assemblies are unavailable locally; this is a known environment limitation, not a project blocker.

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 4
- Total execution time: ~21 min

**By Phase:**
| Phase | Plans | Duration |
| ----- | ----- | -------- |
| 01    | 2     | ~21 min  |
| Phase 03 P01 | 18 min | 3 tasks | 6 files |
| Phase 03 P02 | 9 min | 5 tasks | 10 files |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

- Plugin scaffold architecture: thin entry point (62 lines), UI in dedicated window classes
- Cross-platform build via goatcorp.github.io/dalamud-distrib/latest.zip
- Auto-versioned CI releases: 1.0.{run}.0
- Named category constants: FurnitureIds, CollectibleIds, GlamourIds, DefaultCategoryFilters
- World validation: hash set of 85 FFXIV worlds, case-insensitive
- Repo: public, DarrellTang/namazu-flippers

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

No implementation blockers. Local macOS compiler verification is intentionally replaced by source validation plus CI build verification.
